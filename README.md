- General Configurations:
    * All endpoints/API-Views are protected by IsAuthenticated and Token generation.
    * Settings.py:
        # All apps are registered in INSTALLED_APPS.
        # rest_framewrok + rest_framework.authtoken are registered in INSTALLED_APPS.
        # DRF Configuration:
                REST_FRAMEWORK = {
                                    'DEFAULT_PAGINATION_CLASS': 'rest_framework.pagination.PageNumberPagination',
                                     'PAGE_SIZE': 10, #Global Pagination
                                     'DEFAULT_AUTHENTICATION_CLASSES': [
                                       'rest_framework.authentication.TokenAuthentication', #Token Authentication
                                     ],
                                }
        # User Authentication:
                AUTH_USER_MODEL = "accounts.CustomUser"
    * url.py:
        # API endpoints are included within url_patterns.
                urlpatterns = [
                                path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
                                path('api/', include('projects.urls')),
                                path('api/accounts/', include('accounts.urls')),
                            ]

- Projects requirments and environment:
    * A file called requirements.txt always updated with all installed frameworks and libraries.
        # pip freeze > requirments.txt
    * You can install all requirements to safely and successfully operate the project.
        # pip install -r requirements.txt


- Future expantion and ideas:
    * PDF generating integration.
    * Comments and Notes features.
    * Exapnding the project to include non-medical spaces.
    * Expanding system's users range to include more positions.

=====================================

Deployment Branch

Live API Endpoints

- The backend API is hosted locally and exposed publicly via ngrok. This allows reviewers to access your Django API even though it runs on your machine.

ngrok:

- ngrok is a tool that creates a secure public URL for your local server.
- It forwards internet traffic to your local Django server, so reviewers can test endpoints without needing to deploy to a cloud service.
- Free ngrok URLs are temporary and change every time you restart the tunnel.

Configuring ngrok:

- Install  through website: 
 #      https://ngrok.com/

- Start the Django server locally:
#       python manage.py runserver 8000

- Open a new terminal and start ngrok:
#       ngrok http 8000

- Copy the Forwarding HTTPS URL provided by ngrok (e.g., https://8cd4163424a5.ngrok-free.app)
- Use this URL for all API requests instead of http://127.0.0.1:8000.
- Keep both Django server and ngrok running while testing. Once stopped, the URL will no longer work.



Endpoints

- Get Project Details
#   GET https://8cd4163424a5.ngrok-free.app/api/projects/1/

- Update Space Furniture
#  PATCH https://8cd4163424a5.ngrok-free.app/api/projects/1/plans/2/spaces/1/furnitures/1/update/


- Request body example (JSON):

            {
            "space_id": 1,
            "furniture_id": 1,
            "quantity": 10
            }


Authentication

- The API uses Token Authentication.
- Include your token in the Authorization header:
#    Authorization: Token <your-token-here>

- Example header in Postman:
#    Key: Authorization          Value: Token 1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef



Additional Notes

- Deployment work all in (deployment) branch, so it's not merged into (main) branch for clarity.
- ngrok URLs are temporary; they change every time the tunnel restarts.
- CSRF errors may occur if accessing Django admin via ngrok â€” use your local server instead (http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/).
- Users should only test the API endpoints using the ngrok URL + token.
